# AI-Driven-Soccer-Performance-Analysis-and-Highlight-Generation-System (in-progress)
Engineered an end-to-end computer vision solution to detect and track soccer players and the ball in real-time, automatically generating highlight reels around ball possession, tackles, and passing sequences for comprehensive performance analysis.

I would like to thank @abdullahtarek for providing the base code for this project. His work served as a foundation for my implementation and enhancements.
